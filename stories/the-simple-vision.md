The simple vision

Take a reality, fit it in some data structure gathering all the details you
need to simulate behaviour and depict it on a surface. Now repeat this as fast
as possible. Got it? Ok! That is a simulation.

> That is a game.

I want Hadron design to show just that and nothing more so if you see the
annotated sources you'll see (apart of an inspired way to decouple the
simulation from the frame rate) a simple game step with three steps:

 1. **Simulation** - Read the model, take some decissions and change the model.
 2. **Clearing** - Foresee the area that will become dirty and clear it.
 3. **Rendering** - Read and draw the model.

Sounds simple? I hope so. Let's getting serious in the next episode.
